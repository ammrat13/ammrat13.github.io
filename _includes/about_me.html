    Hey! I'm
    <abbr title="Ammar Ratnani (he/him)">Ammar</abbr>.
    Right now, I'm a software engineer working on
    <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">GeForce NOW</a>,
    but my interests are ... varied. I've done embedded systems, digital
    design, compiler work, and even some math.
</p>

<p>
    I've done some side projects, and I figured my work wasn't doing much just
    sitting around. So, I started this site. Feel free to look through what I've
    done. You might also want to check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/ammrat13">GitHub</a>.
    Don't be afraid to reach out to me either. Shoot me an email, and I'll get
    back to you. (Eventually.)
</p>
