Hey! I'm

Right now, I'm a software engineer working on [GeForce NOW][1], but my interests
are ... varied. I've done embedded systems, digital design, compiler work, and
even some math.

I've done some side projects, and I figured my work wasn't doing much just
sitting around. So, I started this site. Feel free to look through what I've
done. You might also want to check out my [GitHub][2] . Don't be afraid to reach
out to me either. Shoot me an email, and I'll get back to you. (Eventually.)
