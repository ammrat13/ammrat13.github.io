# Personal Site
This repository hosts my personal website. It's built in Jekyll for Github Pages
integration at [ammrat13.github.io](https://ammrat13.github.io). It's also
fairly minimal, containing little more than an about section and some blog
posts.

#### Packages Used
 * `bundler`: Installed from repositories and configured to install packages
              locally by running `bundle config set --local PATH $HOME/.gem`
